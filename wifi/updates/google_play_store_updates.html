     <p>
        Starting last November,  Google Play Store required all applications to conform to new software requirements.  These restrictions prevent applications from performing WiFi functions such as enable/disable, scan for available networks, detect open/secured access points, and connect to another network. These are major functions of WiFi Shortcuts+.
     </p>
     <p>
        WiFi Shortcuts+ is still available for download from Google and functions as expected on platforms including Android 11.  However updates, enhancements, and bug fixes cannot be delivered through Google Play Store due to the restrictions.
     </p>
     <p>
        Free new versions will be posted to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KWCS4MN">Amazon App Store</a>. However , the store cannot upgrade the app from the Play Store; one must first uninstall and then reinstall from Amazon.
     </p>
     <p>
        Additionally, the new versions will be posted on the OpenGait GitHub site.  When posted, WiFi Shortcuts+ will notify you. Upgrading is not required, but recommended.
     </p>
     <p>
        Again, Google restrictions cause this change; <u><b>not WiFi Shortcuts+</b></u>. If you have any questions please contact the developer.
